  <h2>One of the great inavators of the computer age</h2>
  <p>Linus Benedict Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the creator and principal developer of the Linux kernel, which is the kernel for the Linux operating systems and other operating systems such as Android and Chrome OS. He also created the distributed version control system Git.</p>

      <h2>Linus, Peanuts or Chemist?</h2>
      <p>Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland, on 28 December 1969.Torvalds was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize-winning American chemist, although Torvalds is quoted as saying, "I think I was named equally for Linus the Peanuts cartoon character", noting that this makes him half "Nobel Prize-winning chemist" and half "blanket-carrying cartoon character".<br>His interest in computers began with a Commodore VIC-20, at the age of 11 in 1981, initially programming in BASIC, but later by directly accessing the 6502 CPU in machine code (coding with 1s and 0s). After the VIC-20 he purchased a Sinclair QL, which he modified extensively, especially its operating system. "Because it was so hard to get software for it in Finland, Linus wrote his own assembler and editor.</p>

  <h1>Linux</h1>
  <img src='https://www.reallinuxuser.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/linux-logo.jpg' alt='linux'>
  <p> The first prototypes of Linux were publicly released in 1991.Version 1.0 was released on 14 March 1994.
  </p>
  <p>Torvalds first encountered the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Project'>GNU Project</a> in 1991, after another Swedish-speaking computer science student, Lars Wirzenius, took him to the University of Technology to listen to free software guru Richard Stallman's speech. Torvalds used Stallman's GNU General Public License version 2 for his Linux kernel.</p>
  <p>After a visit to Transmeta in late 1996, Torvalds accepted a position at the company in California, where he would work from February 1997 until June 2003. He then moved to the Open Source Development Labs, which has since merged with the Free Standards Group to become the Linux Foundation, under whose auspices he continues to work. In June 2004, Torvalds and his family moved to Dunthorpe, Oregon, to be closer to the OSDL's Beaverton, Oregon-based headquarters.</p>
  <p>From 1997 to 1999, he was involved in 86open helping to choose the standard binary format for Linux and Unix. In 1999, he was named by the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the world's top 100 innovators under age 35.</p>

  <h1>Why Linux Rocks</h1>
  <h2>1. Open Source</h2>
  <p>It's code is free and readily available for anyone to fully customize and distribute for any purpose.</p>
  <h2>2. Security</h2>
  <p>Every program in Linux needs authorization from the admin via password, making linux less vunerable to malware than alternatives.</p>
  <h2>3. Large Community Support</h2>
  <p>Linux has a large and active user base that is constantly updating and improving various linux distributions.</p>
  <h2>4. Stable and Reliable</h2>
  <p>The Windows operating system needs to repoot afting installing certain applications/softwarare or when performance lags. Linux can run at high performance without requiring many/frequent reboots</p>
  <h2>5. Privacy</h2>
  <p>linux collects minimal data from user unlike other operating systems.</p>

  <p>Linus Torvalds is married to Tove Torvalds (nÃ©e Monni)â€”a six-time Finnish national karate championâ€”whom he first met in late 1993. Linus was running introductory computer laboratory exercises for students and instructed the course attendees to send him an e-mail as a test, to which Tove responded with an e-mail asking for a date.[9] Tove and Linus were later married and have three daughters, two of whom were born in the United States.[4] The Linux kernel's reboot system call accepts their dates of birth (written in hexadecimal) as magic values.[50][51]

Torvalds has described himself as "completely a-religiousâ€”atheist", adding that "I find that people seem to think religion brings morals and appreciation of nature. I actually think it detracts from both. It gives people the excuse to say, 'Oh, nature was just created,' and so the act of creation is seen to be something miraculous. I appreciate the fact that, 'Wow, it's incredible that something like this could have happened in the first place.'" He later added that while in Europe religion is mostly a personal issue, in the United States it has become very politicized. When discussing the issue of church and state separation, Torvalds also said, "Yeah, it's kind of ironic that in many European countries, there is actually a kind of legal binding between the state and the state religion."[52] However, in a story about the March LinuxWorld Conference titled "Linus the Liberator", Torvalds is quoted as saying "There are like two golden rules in life. One is 'Do unto others as you would want them to do unto you.' For some reason, people associate this with Christianity. I'm not a Christian. I'm agnostic. The other rule is 'Be proud of what you do.'"[53]

In 2010, Torvalds became a United States citizen and registered to vote in the United States. He is unaffiliated with any U.S. political party, saying, "I have way too much personal pride to want to be associated with any of them, quite frankly."</p>
