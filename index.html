  <h2>One of the great inavators of the computer age</h2>
  <p>Linus Benedict Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the creator and principal developer of the Linux kernel, which is the kernel for the Linux operating systems and other operating systems such as Android and Chrome OS. He also created the distributed version control system Git.</p>

  <h1>Early Years</h1>

    <h2>Linus, Peanuts or Chemist?</h2>
    <p>Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland, on 28 December 1969.Torvalds was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize-winning American chemist, although Torvalds is quoted as saying, "I think I was named equally for Linus the Peanuts cartoon character", noting that this makes him half "Nobel Prize-winning chemist" and half "blanket-carrying cartoon character".</p>       <p>His interest in computers began with a Commodore VIC-20, at the age of 11 in 1981, initially programming in BASIC, but later by directly accessing the 6502 CPU in machine code (coding with 1s and 0s). After the VIC-20 he purchased a Sinclair QL, which he modified extensively, especially its operating system. "Because it was so hard to get software for it in Finland, Linus wrote his own assembler and editor.</p>

  </p>
  <p>Torvalds first encountered the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Project'>GNU Project</a> in 1991, after another Swedish-speaking computer science student, Lars Wirzenius, took him to the University of Technology to listen to free software guru Richard Stallman's speech. Torvalds used Stallman's GNU General Public License version 2 for his Linux kernel.</p>

<div id='linux-rocks'>
  <h1>Why Linux Rocks</h1>
  <h2>1. Open Source</h2>
  <p>It's code is free and readily available for anyone to fully customize and distribute for any purpose.</p>
  <h2>2. Security</h2>
  <p>Every program in Linux needs authorization from the admin via password, making linux less vunerable to malware than alternatives.</p>
  <h2>3. Large Community Support</h2>
  <p>Linux has a large and active user base that is constantly updating and improving various linux distributions.</p>
  <h2>4. Stable and Reliable</h2>
  <p>The Windows operating system needs to repoot afting installing certain applications/softwarare or when performance lags. Linux can run at high performance without requiring many/frequent reboots</p>
  <h2>5. Privacy</h2>
  <p>linux collects minimal data from user unlike other operating systems.</p>

  <h1>Personal Life</h1>

  <h2>A man who has a personal life</h2>
  <p>Linus Torvalds is married to Tove Torvalds (nÃ©e Monni)â€”a six-time Finnish national karate championâ€”whom he first met in late 1993. Linus was running introductory computer laboratory exercises for students and instructed the course attendees to send him an e-mail as a test, to which Tove responded with an e-mail asking for a date.[9] Tove and Linus were later married and have three daughters, two of whom were born in the United States.[4] The Linux kernel's reboot system call accepts their dates of birth (written in hexadecimal) as magic values.[50][51]

  <h2>Hi, I'm David ðŸ˜Š</h2>
  <p>I am a Junior at the Colorado School of Mines studying
Computer Science. I have special interest in Data Science as
well as Statistics. Iâ€™m using Free Code Camp to get involved in the coding community and offer my help if I can. Iâ€™ve also been doing front end coding for 4 years off and on but love doing it. I am currently working on simple javascript games which I will be happy to share soon!</p>
